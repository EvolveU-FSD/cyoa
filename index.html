        Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso
        machine? You really think you can fly that thing? Yeah, but John, if The
        Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the
        tourists. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to
        decompose.

        Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they
        could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Hey, you know how I'm,
        like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. They're using
        our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.

        Checkmate... What do they got in there? King Kong? Yes, Yes, without the
        oops! Checkmate... Yes, Yes, without the oops! Do you have any idea how
        long it takes those cups to decompose. Hey, take a look at the
        earthlings. Goodbye! Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat
        lady! Drive us out of here!
